        "question": "A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\n1. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\n2.
