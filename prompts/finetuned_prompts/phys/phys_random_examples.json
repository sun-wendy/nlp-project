After the light bulb has been lit for a few moments, how has the net charge residing on the circuit elements changed?\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. The net charge has become more positive.\n1. The net charge has become more negative.\n2. The net charge has not changed.\n3. Whether the net charge becomes more positive or more negative depends on the initial net charge residing on the circuit elements before the bulb was lit.\nAnswer: 2\n\nA children\u2019s toy consists of a cart whose very light wheels are attached to a rubber band. This rubber band can wind and unwind around the axle supporting the wheels. This toy is given a shove, after which the toy rolls across a flat surface and up a ramp. It is observed that the toy does not go a consistent distance up the ramp\u2014in some trials it ends up higher than in other trials, even though the shove imparts the same kinetic energy to the cart each time. Which of the following is a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon?\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. Depending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred from the rubber band to the kinetic energy of the car\u2019s motion.\n1. The normal force on the cart\u2019s wheels will be different depending on how much the rubber band winds or unwinds.\n2. How much energy is transferred from kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height at which the cart ends up.\n3. Some of the cart\u2019s initial kinetic energy will be dissipated due to work done by friction.\nAnswer: 0\n\nA rod measures 1.00 m in its rest system.
