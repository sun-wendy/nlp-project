The sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\n1. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n2. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\n3. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.\nAnswer: 3\n\nFor EDTA titrations, the analyte solution and the titrant solution are both buffered at the same pH for which of the following reasons?\nI. The conditional formation constant is affected by pH.\nII. The fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form varies with pH.\nIII. When EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, H+ is a product in most cases.\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. I only\n1. I and II only\n2. I and III only\n3. I, II, and III\nAnswer: 3\n\nWhich of the following is a reduction half-reaction? (1) Cu2+ + e- \u2192 Cu+ (2) Cu+ + e- \u2192 Cu0 (3) Fe2+ \u2192 Fe3+ + e-\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. 1 only because copper(II) ions are reduced\n1. 3 only because the iron is reduced\n2. 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions\n3. 1 and 3 because they do not have insoluble ions\nAnswer: 2\n\nCalculate the magnetic moment (\u03bcI) of a 13C nucleus.\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. 6.1445 x 10^-27 J T-1\n1. 3.1445 x 10^-27 J T-1\n2. 9.1445 x 10^-27 J T-1\n3. 1.1445 x 10^-28 J T-1\nAnswer: ",
