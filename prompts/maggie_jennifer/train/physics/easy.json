Which of the following is a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon?\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. Depending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred from the rubber band to the kinetic energy of the car’s motion.\n1. The normal force on the cart’s wheels will be different depending on how much the rubber band winds or unwinds.\n2. How much energy is transferred from kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height at which the cart ends up.\n3.
