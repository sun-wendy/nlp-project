    "question": "Function signatures describe the types of the arguments to a function as well as the return value of the function. For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of\nadd : real x real -> real\nsince it takes two real numbers and returns a real number. But, for a language that allows functions as return values, addition could be considered to have the signature\nadd : real -> (real -> real)\nwhich means that add takes a single real (the first operand) and returns a new function that itself takes a single real (the second operand) and returns a real (the result). This process of reducing a function with multiple arguments to a function with fewer arguments is called currying. Which of the following is correct?\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\nA. Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument.\nB.
