        "question": "Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. The tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?\nChoose the best answer from the following options:\n0. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n1. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n2. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n3. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\nAnswer: 2\n\nTwo simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively.
